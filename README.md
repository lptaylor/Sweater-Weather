# About SweaterWeather

Sweater Weather five day solo project at Turing School of Software and Design to consume multiple external APIs and create a backend for a future front end project. There are eight endpoints for this API currently that offer various functionality as detailed below.

## Learning Goals

* Consuming various APIs
* Making an API
* Learning to design in a purely backend setting
* Developer empathy for anyone who would need to use this to design a front end from it

## Getting Started && Prerequisites

## Testing

Your location should be the root directory of the project (`Sweater-Weather`).

From the command line run `rspec`
(This can take a moment)

`Green` is passing.
